# Patient-Readmittance-analysis

## Big Data project in Python Using Apache Pyspark, Pandas and Numpy Libraries

**The objective of this project is to determine whether a patient would be readmitted and if readmitted,
would they visit the hospital within 30 days or after 30 days. The expected outcome of this project is a
classification model that will determine if a new incoming patient has diabetes and if he/she will be readmitted
again.We also expect to find out if the readmission is due to incorrect treatment or the patient’s condition.
The overarching goal of this project is to improve healthcare pertaining to diabetes and reduce a patient’s visit
to a healthcare provider, thus saving time and money**
